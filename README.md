🧑🏻‍🚀COSMO is a conversation agent with greater generalizability on both in- and out-of-domain chitchat datasets (e.g., DailyDialog, BlendedSkillTalk). It is trained on two datasets: SODA and ProsocialDialog. COSMO is especially aiming to model natural human conversations. It can accept situation descriptions as well as instructions on what role it should play in the situation.

COSMO is trained on our two recent datasets: 🥤SODA (https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/soda) and Prosocial Dialog (https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/prosocial-dialog). The backbone model of COSMO is the lm-adapted T5 (https://huggingface.co/google/t5-xl-lm-adapt).
